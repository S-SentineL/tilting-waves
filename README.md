# Tilting Waves

In this game, your goal is to bring all the balls to the center circle by carefully maneuvering them. Be strategic, plan your moves, and enjoy the challenge!

## Gameplay

- **Objective:** Move all the balls to the center circle. The balls combine when they overlap each other, making it easier to collect them in the center.
- **Joystick:** Use the joystick on the right side of the screen to move the balls. Push it in different directions to guide the balls and keep them balanced.
- **Hard Mode:** Press **'H'** to switch to Hard Mode, where you’ll need to avoid black holes that appear in the game. They’ll try to suck in your balls, so be extra careful!

## How to Play

1. Use the joystick to move the balls toward the center circle.
2. When two balls overlap, they will combine into one ball. You can use this feature to your advantage when gathering balls into the center.
3. To activate **Hard Mode**, press the **'H'** key. In this mode, black holes appear that you must avoid. If a ball gets too close to a black hole, it will get pulled in and lost.
4. The goal is to have all balls safely in the center circle while avoiding obstacles and managing your movements.

## Controls

- **Joystick (right side):** Move the balls in any direction.
- **'H' key:** Activate **Hard Mode**, introducing black holes that you must avoid.
- **'E' key:** Activate **Easy Mode**, where there are no black holes and the difficulty is reduced.
- **Center Circle:** The target where you need to bring all the balls.

## Tips

- Combine balls by moving them on top of each other to make them more manageable.
- In **Hard Mode**, stay alert and avoid black holes at all costs!
- Plan your path carefully to prevent the balls from getting stuck in tricky spots.
